## Homebrew telnet bbs program 
### by Jon Bradley (aka kreator)

A bbs that is currently running on OpenBSD which has the flavor
of an old Commodore 64 bbs.  40 column text and all.
I wrote started writing this bbs around 1998, since then has been
running at velvet.ath.cx to this date (March 8th 2011), a very
small set of regulars have been users for just about as long.

contact me: weatchu AT gmail.com -OR- login to The Shack, with
any telnet client at the address: velvet.ath.cx  Running 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week :)
